### Stanford CS342 - Building for Digital Health

As our world becomes more and more digitized, patients and their devices are generating streams of valuable data that can provide meaningful clinical insights. This digital health revolution provides great opportunities to design and validate new digital health concepts. Many groups within Stanford Medicine have promising ideas that are ripe for development, however, they lack the software engineering and healthcare compliance know-how to take them forward.

**Building for Digital Health** is a Biodesign course sponsored by the Stanford School of Medicine (SoM) and Stanfordâ€™s Computer Science (CS) department. Its goal is to provide CS students with the opportunity to apply their skills to real-world health technology development projects, while enabling SoM faculty to leverage these talented individuals to help advance their technology concepts toward patients. Both audiences will learn a repeatable approach for developing new digital health technologies and preparing to launch them in the market.

Over the course of ten weeks, students and faculty will work together to tackle a project and launch an app-enabled solution for research use. Every week, students will learn about app-development, sensor technologies, privacy, security, and more. In the final week of class, teams will present their final project (app) to a panel of digital health experts.
